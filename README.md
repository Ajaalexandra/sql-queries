# SQL, Days 1-3

In the next three days, we'll learn how to persist our application's data in a database. To do this, we'll be using SQL, or Structured Query Language.

## Day 1
First, we'll focus on the Create and Read operations of CRUD. We will create tables, insert data into them, and retrieve data from those tables. 

If we have time, we'll also cover a few more advanced Read operations, including aggregate functions and subqueries. 

Open the Day 1 folder for more detailed instructions.

## Day 2
If we don't cover the Update and Delete operations of CRUD on Day 1, we'll cover those on Day 2. We'll also move on to the more advanced concepts, including joins, foreign keys, aggregate functions, and maybe unions.

If we have time, I'd like to introduce Postgres, the database server we'll be using. 

Open the Day 2 folder for more information.

## Day 3
Finally, we'll review the operations in SQL that you have now mastered, and we'll learn how to host your local databases on Postgres and how to connect them to your Node/Express application.

Open the Day 3 folder for more information.
